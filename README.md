# Bluez-HID-over-GATT-Keyboard-Emulator-Example

A working example ran on my Raspberry PI4-b with Buuster Raspbian-Lite for all to use. My desire is to hopefully save at least one other person the literal weeks I've spent trying to get this working for my little home automation project.

Verified working on my Blade Android, my Windows 10 laptop, and my Amazon FireTV stick

NOTE: Ensure you use Bluez Version 5.56 or better. This example uses Bluez features that were only experimental in prior versions.
